# DiagonalScrollView Implementation

## Overview
The DiagonalScrollView is a custom ViewGroup that enables simultaneous horizontal and vertical scrolling (diagonal scrolling) within a single touch gesture. This solves the issue where users had to change direction twice to scroll diagonally in nested ScrollViews.

## Features
- **True Diagonal Scrolling**: Users can scroll in any direction with a single gesture
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Supports fling gestures for momentum-based scrolling
- **Touch Handling**: Properly handles touch events for responsive scrolling
- **Boundary Management**: Automatically limits scrolling to content boundaries
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient layout and drawing operations

## Usage in Timeline
The timeline now uses DiagonalScrollView to contain both the header and RecyclerView content, allowing users to:

1. **Scroll Horizontally**: To view expanded month/day columns
2. **Scroll Vertically**: To view different years/ages
3. **Scroll Diagonally**: To navigate to any part of the timeline seamlessly

## Implementation Details
- Replaces nested HorizontalScrollView + NestedScrollView structure
- Single container for both header and timeline content
- Synchronized header and content scrolling automatically
- No need for manual scroll synchronization code

## Touch Behavior
- **Single Finger**: Scrolls in any direction based on touch movement
- **Fling Gestures**: Continues scrolling with momentum
- **Boundaries**: Stops at content edges automatically
- **Responsive**: Immediate feedback to touch input

This implementation provides a much more intuitive and smooth user experience for navigating the expandable timeline columns.
